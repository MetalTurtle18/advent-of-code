# Advent of Code 2024

## Day 1
As a result of not have touched Python in a very long time and being in EST and waking up from an accidental nap 3 minutes before the puzzle was released, this took longer than intended.

## Day 2
Day 1 of forgetting how Python deals with references to arrays and having problems because of it and then remembering that deepcopy solves all my problems.

## Day 3
Love me some regular expressions
