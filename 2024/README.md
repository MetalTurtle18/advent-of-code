# Advent of Code 2024

Let's see how this goes.

## Day 1
As a result of not have touched Python in a very long time and being in EST and waking up from an accidental nap 3 minutes before the puzzle was released, this took longer than intended.

## Day 2
Day 1 of forgetting how Python deals with references to arrays and having problems because of it and then remembering that deepcopy solves all my problems.

## Day 3
Love me some regular expressions

## Day 4
Decent. Mildly cursed Python fun.

## Day 5
Spent way too long trying think of a proper way to do part one before resorting to quadruple nested for loop brute force goodness. It is frightening to see the puzzle input not return instantly (foreshadowing? Unsure, I am writing this before reading part 2)...

Part 2: I kinda just went with the simplest brute force idea I could think of, and it worked first try. Takes about the same time as part 1. Cool I guess.

## Day 6
Brute force still works...this one takes a minute though.

## Day 7
Thank goodness for unlimited integers in Python!

## Day 8
This one sounded hard on first read but turned out to be straightforward. Luckily part 2 was a super easy modification. It was also really easy to make a simple visualization for this puzzle to visually verify the test case.

## Day 9
Longest one yet...maybe because 30 minutes was spent unsure of how to deal with two-digit IDs. Unfortunately, part 2 was not free today. But I still got it!
